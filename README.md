## Introduction
This topic provides some customers'1-minute driving behavior data and the corresponding customer's compensation rate as training set, including longitude and latitude positioning and driving status (desensitization). Teams need to carry out data mining and necessary machine learning training. In addition, we will provide the driving behavior data of other customers in the same period for evaluation, to test whether your algorithm can accurately identify the driving risk of customers at that time.

Unlike previous competitions, due to the problem of data security, the data training set and evaluation set of this competition are not open to the public. The contestants submit not the data evaluation results but the platform executable Python code. See [Data Download and Evaluation] for specific submission requirements. In order to facilitate players to better understand the data, the enterprise will provide some sample data.
